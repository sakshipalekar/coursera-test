				<p>What’s better than having a crispy melty pizza, you ask?

Having that crispy and melty pizza in the comfort of your own home with the ones you love, we say.No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose your toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken, the options are almost endless!
